This is a project for the Machine Learning course in the Master's program in Computer Engineering

### Acces
Click [here](https://oasis-dataset-alzheimer-prediction.streamlit.app/) to access the app

### Dataset
To load the OASIS dataset, click [here](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/home/oasis-2/).
If you prefer, you can download it from this repository, but for ethical reasons, itâ€™s better to do it from the official page.

### Data exploration and model training and test
The source code where the dataset was explored, the data was prepared, and the model was developed can be found in the `modelo` directory, in the file named `oasis_completo.ipynb`. In this file, the data from the dataset is explored, and the results of logistic regression are compared to logistic regression using K-Fold. Additionally, linear, polynomial, and Gaussian SVM models are compared.
In the `Model`, there are also other file: `oasis_implementacion.py`, It is the .py file that was used to train the best models; additionally, a pipeline for data processing was implemented.

### Best model
In the folder, you will find 5 .pkl files corresponding to the models and the pipeline used in the app.

### APP
You will find two files: `requirements.txt` and `streamlit_app.py`. The first contains the libraries required to run the app. The second is the app code (model implementation and interface).
